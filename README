SleepyHead v1.1 branch

*Warning*, backup your SleepyHeadData directory before using this branch as there will be no going backwards

SleepyHead is cross platform, opensource sleep tracking program for reviewing CPAP and Oximetry data, 
which are devices used in the treatment of Sleep Disorders like Obstructive Sleep Apnea.

SleepyHead is written by Mark Watkins (aka Jedimark), an Australian software developer afflicted with sleep apnea.

SleepyHead is copyright (C) 2011-2018 Mark Watkins <mark@jedimark.net>

Requirements:
-------------
Qt5 SDK with webkit (Qt5.5 from http://qt.io/download-open-source recommended)
Linux needs libudev-dev for qserialport to compile

OSX needs Xcode and commandline tools from AppStore

Windows needs MinGW (in Qt5 SDK) or VC++2013 Express (and matching Qt libraries)

Building:
--------

Recommend shadow building to not cruft up the source code folder:

cd ..
mkdir build_sleepyhead
cd build_sleepyhead
qmake ../sleepyhead-code/SleepyHeadQT.pro 
make

You may need to add a -spec option to qmake to suit your platform. 
Adding -j3 speeds up the make command on a dual core or greater system.

Building on OSX:
---------------
Build as above. If qmake fails with the error:
Project ERROR: Xcode not set up properly. You may need to confirm the license agreement by running /usr/bin/xcodebuild
edit the file: 
QT_INSTALL_DIR/5.5/clang_64/mkspecs/features/mac/default_pre.prf

and replace
/usr/bin/xcrun -find xcrun 2>/dev/null

with
/usr/bin/xcrun -find xcodebuild 2>/dev/null



Software Licensing Information
------------------------------
SleepyHead is released under the GNU GPL v3 License. Please see below for a note on giving correct attribution
in redistribution of derivatives.

It is built using Qt SDK (Open Source Edition), available from http://qt.io.

It also uses QuaZip, by Sergey A. Tachenov, which is a C++ wrapper over Gilles Vollant's ZIP/UNZIP package
http://sourceforge.net/projects/quazip/

Redistribution of derivatives
-----------------------------
I created this software to help lessen the exploitation of others. Seeing my work being used to exploit others 
is incredibly un-motivational, and incredibly disrespectful of all the work I put into this project.

If you plan on reselling any derivatives of SleepyHead, I specifically request that you give due credit and 
link back, mentioning clearly in your advertising material, software installer and about screens that your 
derivative "is based on the free and open-source software SleepyHead available from http://sleepyhead.jedimark.net, 
developed and copyright by Mark Watkins (C) 2011-<current year>."

It is not enough to reference that your derivative "is based on GPL software".

Working on this after @Jedimark
-------------------------------
I don't really know what I'm doing so any help would be appreciated. Make issues or whatever and I will see what I can do, no promises.
I have no idea what issues there are currently or what features need to be added so please just open feature requests and issues.
Thank you.
